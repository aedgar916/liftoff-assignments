### Overview
Include overview here

My app helps those with eating disorders but is also great for anyone needing to keep track of their food intake. It allows users to enter what they eat for meals and snacks as well as any feelings they have about eating and food. They can save these entries for themselves, and they can send the information to their care team. The care team member can create an account to comment on the person's entries and adjust their meal plan as needed. People without eating disorders could also use this to monitor their eating habits, and they do not have to send the information to anyone if they don't need or want to.

As someone who is in recovery from an eating disorder, I thought this would be an easy and effective way to keep my care team up-to-date on how I'm doing while also being able to comment on how I'm doing so I don't feel so alone in this process.
